  whatIsRebalancing: `
        Portfolio rebalancing is the art of adjusting your investments to maintain a desired balance. 
        It's a method to realign your portfolio. If certain assets have shifted due to market fluctuations, 
        rebalancing ensures they align with your original objectives.
    `,

  whyIsItImportant: `
        Rebalancing safeguards your investment strategy. Over time, as market conditions change, 
        some assets might outperform others, skewing your portfolio's initial balance. Without timely 
        rebalancing, you risk deviating from your desired risk level. Moreover, the act of periodically 
        selling assets that have appreciated and purchasing those that are undervalued can optimize your returns.

  algorithmOverview: `
        The algorithm meticulously evaluates your current portfolio in comparison to your chosen target allocation. 
        It identifies any variances and crafts specific buy or sell actions to realign your holdings. Key to its decision 
        process is the P/E ratio, a significant stock valuation metric. A high P/E ratio might indicate an overvalued stock, 
        whereas a low one could hint at a potentially undervalued asset. Using this data, the algorithm offers discerning 
        guidance on stock portfolio adjustments.
